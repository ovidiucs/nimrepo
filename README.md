# nimrepo

Just messing about in this language. Comming with a bit of python the language has some nice feature such as C compilation and also JS,
python-like syntax, static typing vs dynamic i'm meh..., custom GC, tunable GC, statically linked binaries, easier to redistribuite binariers, 
concurency is easier here but meh..
