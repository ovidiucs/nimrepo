Just messing about in this language. Comming with a bit of python the language has some nice feature such as C compilation and also JS,
python-like syntax, static typing vs dynamic i'm meh..., custom GC, tunable GC, statically linked binaries, easier to redistribuite binariers, 
concurency is easier here but meh.. 

List of things to pin down:

- [ ] iterators
- [ ] ufcs
- [ ] closures
- [ ] templates
- [ ] macros
- [ ] generics
- [ ] types and typesets
- [ ] enums
- [ ] async
- [ ] pragmas
- [ ] static[T]
- [ ] abstract syntax tree and how to manipulate it through macros
- [ ] unittesting(important) 
- [ ] composition and inheritance
- [ ] documenting(important)
- [ ] project structure/ layout
- [ ] object orientation and methods
- [ ] procs and funcs
